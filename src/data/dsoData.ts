M81 is a grand design spiral galaxy with well-defined spiral arms and a bright nucleus, while M82 is a starburst galaxy undergoing a period of intense star formation, likely triggered by gravitational interactions with M81 about 600 million years ago. The pair are the largest members of the M81 Group, one of the nearest galaxy groups to our Local Group. M82 is particularly notable for its high star formation rate, which is about 10 times that of our Milky Way, and its superwind of hot gas being ejected from its central regions, which makes it one of the most studied galaxies in the sky.',

The nebula is shaped by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star colliding with the slower-moving gas that was ejected when the star was in its red giant phase. The nebula gets its distinctive shape from these powerful stellar winds, which have blown a large, nearly spherical bubble in the surrounding interstellar medium.

The nebula has been noted to be having a shape suggestive of a human skull, and is sometimes referred to as the "Skull Nebula," though this name is more commonly used for NGC 246, a planetary nebula in Cetus. The cluster and nebula lie at a distance of 5,200 light-years from Earth and measure roughly 130 light years in diameter. The radiation from the young stars excites the atoms in the nebula, causing them to emit radiation themselves producing the emission nebula we see. The mass of the nebula is estimated to be around 10,000 solar masses.',

The nebula was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731, and it corresponds with a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.\n\nAt the center of the nebula lies the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 28â30 km across that emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second. The nebula was the first source to be identified as a historical supernova explosion. The nebula acts as a source of radiation for studying celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun\'s corona was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula\'s radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn\'s moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.',

    fullDescription: 'Markarian\'s Chain is a stretch of galaxies that forms part of the Virgo Cluster. It is named after the Armenian astrophysicist Benjamin Markarian, who discovered their common motion in the early 1960s. The chain consists of at least 8 bright galaxies, including several Messier objects, that appear to move coherently rather than independently. The chain is located in the core of the Virgo Cluster, about 50-70 million light-years away, and includes both elliptical and spiral galaxies. The most prominent members of the chain are the giant elliptical galaxies M84 and M86, which are surrounded by several other bright galaxies including the interacting pair NGC 4438 and NGC 4435 (known as "The Eyes"). The chain is a popular target for amateur astronomers due to the number of bright galaxies that can be seen in a relatively small area of the sky.',

The nebula gets its name from its jellyfish-like shape, with a semicircular shell and tentacle-like filaments of gas. The supernova explosion that created IC 443 left behind a rapidly spinning neutron star (pulsar) known as CXOU J061705.3+222127, which is located near the edge of the remnant. The nebula is interacting with a nearby molecular cloud, which is causing shock waves that heat the gas and make it glow in various wavelengths, from radio to X-rays.

    fullDescription: 'The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is a giant interstellar cloud in the constellation Sagittarius, approximately 4,100 light-years from Earth. This stunning emission nebula is one of only two star-forming nebulae faintly visible to the naked eye from mid-northern latitudes. The nebula gets its name from the dark lane of dust that divides it into two sections, resembling a lagoon. At its center lies the open cluster NGC 6530, containing many hot, young stars that illuminate the surrounding gas. The most prominent feature is the hourglass-shaped region near the center, which is being shaped by the intense radiation and stellar winds from the young, massive star Herschel 36. The nebula spans about 110 by 50 light-years and is an active stellar nursery where new stars continue to form within its dense molecular clouds.',
